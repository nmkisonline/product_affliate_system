After analyzing some of the files from the repository, here are some suggestions and fixes:

1. **JavaScript Files**:
   - In `myjs.js` (both in the root and admin directories), ensure that you're using strict mode by adding `'use strict';` at the top of the file. This helps in catching common coding bounties and prevents the use of potentially problematic features of JavaScript.
   - Ensure that you're handling errors properly, especially for AJAX calls. For instance, if you're using jQuery's `$.ajax()`, make sure to have error callbacks or use `.fail()` to handle any issues that might arise during the request.
   - Avoid using global variables. If you need to share data between functions, consider using closures or modular patterns.

2. **PHP Files**:
   - In files like `dashboard-links.php`, `footer.php`, `header.php`, and `sidebar.php`, ensure that you're sanitizing and validating any data that comes from the user or an external source before using it. This helps prevent potential security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
   - Use prepared statements for SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
   - Ensure that you're checking user permissions appropriately, especially in the admin section, to prevent unauthorized access or actions.

3. **Database**:
   - In the `product_affliate_system.sql` file, ensure that you're setting appropriate constraints and indexes on your tables. This not only ensures data integrity but can also improve performance.
   - Regularly backup your database and consider implementing logging to track changes and actions.

4. **General**:
   - Consider adding a `README.md` file to your repository to provide information about the project, how to set it up, and any other relevant details. This makes it easier for others (or even yourself in the future) to understand and work with the project.
   - Ensure that you're using version control best practices, like meaningful commit messages, and regularly pushing your changes to the repository.

Please note that these are general suggestions based on the files I analyzed. A deeper and more thorough review might reveal more specific issues or areas of improvement. If you'd like more detailed feedback on specific files or parts of your code, please let me know!
